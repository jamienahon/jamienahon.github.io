        <b style="font-size: 28px;">About Me</b><br />
        I have a deep passion for both playing and developing video games. I acquired an Advanced Diploma of <br />
        Professional Game Development while studying at The Academy of Interactive Entertainment and have <br />
        created several small and large projects throughout my studies.<br /><br />
        I am familiar with both the C# and C++ programming languages, and have a great understanding of the <br />
        Unity Game Engine.
