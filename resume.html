            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Education / Qualifications:</b><br />

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Experience: </b><br />
            &#x2022; Currently working as a casual in the produce section at Ritchies IGA in Yarra Glen and have been since 2021.<br />
            My duties include cutting and wrapping fruit, stocking shelves, and cleaning. I have also had to temporarily take the<br />
            role of produce manager several times, and the duties I performed during those times included making and submitting <br />
            stock orders daily, recording produce related invoices, and taking produce related phone calls.<br /><br />
            &#x2022; I have successfully completed 5 game jams with friends. During these game jams my primary role was to design<br />
            levels, help make general design decisions, create pixel art, and help program the games.<br /><br />
            &#x2022; I have developed 3 demo-games with groups of students for assessment tasks for the university I attended.<br />
            For both games, my role was a programmer, but the projects also required me to contribute to game ideas, create <br />
            technical documentation for the games, and communicate with other team members to aid in the development of the projects.<br /><br />
            &#x2022; I have created mutiple small applications and games as part of my study for the university I attended. <br />
            These include a basic custom physics engine, a basic custom rendering engine, and a procedural generation application<br />
            that uses the wave function collapse algorithm.<br /><br />
            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Skills:</b><br />
            &#x2022; I have experience in both the C# and C++ programming languages.<br /><br />
            &#x2022; I have experience in the Unity Game Engine.<br /><br />
            &#x2022; While working at Ritchies IGA in Yarra Glen I have developed good time management, communication, and <br />
            productivity skills.<br /><br />
            &#x2022; I have also developed good collaboration and planning skills while creating games for game jams, and those<br />
            skills have been further improved through the projects worked on during my study at AIE.
